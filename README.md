# script framework that scans domains for vulnerabilities

#   this will be an attempt to create a full 0-100 series of
#   scripts,functions,etc that can be run to automate bug bounty
#   searches and scans and enumerations and logging of data etc.
#   initial domain will set off a chain of events.
#   nmap scan,nikto scan, theHarvester scan, maybe amass scan?
#   results are sent to text file,(database)
#
#
#
#
#
#
#   what needs to be done:
#   -cleaning and fixing between each step,
#   -list of things to search for in data base of returned scan info
#   -
#
#
#
#   a main script/program will run and it  will contain all 3 main scripts
#   1: collection of data
#   2: searching through data collected for certain things
#   3: results of things found
